# Apollo-Launcher

Oakland University Apollo Launcher
CIT480 Senior Capstone Project

Apollo Launcher was designed to be a simple, lightweight, and easy to use launcher with centralized access to many things on your device.

We decided to use the open source KISS Launcher (see below) as a base to build our ideas off of. 

- Apollo Launcher searches through apps, contacts, and settings on your device
- Features new favorites menu
- Updated more modern UI with contextual animations and Material Design concepts
